# airbnb_seattle

## Installations:

The project has been done in the Anaconda enviroment with python 3.6 No packages outside anaconda is nescessary.

## Motivation:

This project has been conducted as a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The Students were to pick a dataset, come up with some questions and answer those questions through a blogpost. The questions I chos was:

how to get the best price
how to get better reviews
Find days where demand for rooms is more

## Summary

I found that the main driver for prices are how many people a listing can accommodate. Location is also very important aswell as aminities such as TV, parking, Internet and air condition. In order to get good reviews it is  vital to respond to every inquiry and dont have limitations on maximum nights. those who list many appartments gets worse reviews than thos who only list their own. Amenities are also important for good reviews.

Also generated plot to determine when booking of rooms is more.
